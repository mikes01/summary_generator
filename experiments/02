Human:
Elasticsearch is a great data store for implementing full-text search and analytics.
Let’s require the Elasticsearch gem and Ruby’s JSON library, and make sure our Elasticsearch instance is up and running.
When a search is performed within a particular patient’s data, Elasticsearch would need to search several different shards and then combine those results.
By providing a specific route, Elasticsearch will know to store a particular patient’s data in the shard specified by the route.
If you expect to have a very large amount of data stored in your Elasticsearch instance, you will need to use filtered index aliases with routing, otherwise your cluster’s performance will degrade significantly.
