Human:
Just like Flutterby does when you’re exporting your site to its static version, the first thing it will do is read your source directory and build an in-process object graph from all the files it encounters.
When a file changes in the filesystem, we obviously want this change to be reflected when viewing the site, so this graph needs to be updated.
The currently released version of Flutterby has a very brute-force approach to this: whenever it detects a change in the file system, it reloads the entire graph from scratch.
Other frameworks may do this through URL rewriting hacks; in the world of Flutterby, you shapeshift the graph that represents your site before it gets exported (or served.) Yes, you literally create new directories and move files – except that you do this purely in memory, by modifying the site graph.
The :setup event will be triggered by Flutterby once the site graph has been created fully, and before Flutterby starts exporting or serving your site.
