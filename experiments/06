Human:
In this article I will only be talking about the now recommended way of installing and running Docker, using Docker for X, where X is the OS rather than the old approach of using Docker toolbox.
Please note, if you are running Windows 10 Home, then you will need to be using Docker toolbox rather than Docker for Windows.
In this instance, I shall be installing and running Docker for Windows, however, the contents of this document are the same regardless of which OS you are running (hence the beauty of Docker).
Most official images can be found on Docker’s own service called Docker Hub, which is akin to GitHub for Git.
Docker Compose is a service provided by Docker as part of the installation as a means of booting and managing multiple Docker images at the same time, all in one place.
