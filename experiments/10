Human:
Investing a little bit of time and effort will decrease the likelihood of ending up with a outdated web of dependencies where no one knows why you’re using all these gems in the first place.
This seems commonly known by now: If you’re working on a application, like a Rails app, you want to have the exact same dependencies on your developer machine, the CI server and the production environment.
Most gems that you declare in your Gemfile have dependencies themselves.
The more groups you have the more you have to think which group a gem belongs to and the harder it is to understand which gem gets loaded when.
It only takes a little bit of effort to improve things. Taking care of your Gemfile with basic hygiene and some ongoing love will make life for future you much easier.
